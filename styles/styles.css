/* Selecting every single div with a descendant combinator */

/* main div {

} */

/* Child combinator in effect ( > ) */

/* main > div {
  Select all child 'class' of div within main
}

main > div > div {
  Basically selecting the grand-children of main
  or all the children of main's children with a 'class' of div
}

Adjacent selector ( + ) will select neighbors of the element we target

.group1 + div {
  Selects group1 by class name and any adjacent element or adjacent sibling, so group2
}

.group + div + div {
  Here we move or skip a neighbor and jump from group2 over to group3 starting from group1
  group3 is an adjacent of group1's adjacent which is what we were looking for
}

General sibling combinator ( ~ )

.group1 ~ div {
  Selects all siblings / neighbors of class name div group1
} */
